When I first got my watch, I was manually checking my O2 levels a few times a day, but then the newness of this feature faded. Now I’m just letting my watch monitor my O2 levels in the background as I work, as I exercise, and when I wear my watch sometimes when I sleep (we’ll get into this more in the next section). Then, when I’m feeling curious, I’ll check my levels in the Health app on my iPhone, which lets me instantly see high and low O2 levels for any given day, or delve into the day view and see the exact times it checked and what the levels were.</p>\n<p>I really like this feature, and think that is has great usefulness, especially when paired with workout or sleep tracking; however, I think it could be improved in two ways. The first is that I’d like to see my O2 levels when I finish a workout activity in the summary screen and then be able to also see those levels when I pull up my activity history in the Fitness app. The second is that whenever I wake up in the morning and get the summary screen, I should also be able to see my overnight O2 levels at a glance. I feel like surfacing this information and making it extremely glanceable would be an improvement over what we currently have in watchOS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sleep-tracking\">Sleep Tracking</h3>\n<p>Before Apple announced the sleep tracking features of the Apple Watch, I had been using an <a href=\"https://ouraring.com\">Oura Ring</a> to track sleeping activity since the start of 2020. This small device gives a lot of information about your sleep activity, including the time spent in the different phases of sleep and can even track your temperature as you sleep, which can indicate issues with sleep quality in the Oura app.</p>\n<p>Going into using the Apple Watch as a sleep tracker, I was expecting some great data points like what Oura can provide; however, I was a bit disappointed with the metrics that the Apple Watch tracks. It gets the basics correct, but I would like to see improved tracking abilities, such as the phases of sleep, movement tracking, quality of sleep, and detailed heart rate tracking during sleep.</p>\n<p>The current iteration of Apple’s sleep tracking on Watch is good, but not great, and doesn’t provide insightful data that I can use to adjust lifestyle changes that can affect my sleep. I really hope that either a future watchOS update or another Apple Watch model with better sensors geared towards sleep tracking will be able to provide additional information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"speed\">Speed</h3>\n<p>My previous Apple Watch (a Series 4) was beginning to get a little slow with watchOS 6, so I was looking forward to seeing how fast the Apple Watch Series 6 can handle the new updates with watchOS 7.</p>\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 6 is more than capable of keeping up with everything that I’ve thrown at it and the new animation times in watchOS 7 makes it feel even snappier on all of the Apple Watch models that support the new OS. Siri activates faster, apps launch faster, and notifications appear faster. Overall, this is a huge improvement since upgrading from a Series 4 Watch.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I am really enjoying the new Apple Watch and all of the features, and cannot wait to see how the features of O2 tracking and sleep improve in the future.

I always enjoy giving out candy and just the general spirit of celebrating the beginning of fall and all that it brings: Cooler weather, and of course, family gatherings. This year is a bit different though.\n\nIn lieu of celebrating Halloween in person with family and trick-or-treaters (don't worry, I'm still leaving pre-packaged candy lined on the sidewalk for trick-or-treaters to take in a socially distanced fashion), I'm instead celebrating by watching some of my favorite Halloween movies. \n\nHere's my list of movies that I'm watching this year leading up to Halloween: \n\n1. The Nightmare Before Christmas\n2. Hocus Pocus\n3. The Haunted Mansion \n4. It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown (now on Apple TV+ for free)\n5. The last 10 years of \"Treehouse of Horrors\" from the Simpsons \n\n",

The recorded videos were also available immediately due to the fact that Apple didn&rsquo;t have to send them to post production to iron out any issues.
